# Ntraceroute
Testing my knowledge. This is my version of traceroute / tracert, of course with much fewer options and functionality, indeed, it's do what's her name says... basically

```
==========================================================
			NTraceroute
		     Where's my packet?
==========================================================

You need to inform the target you will track.
Example: ./my_tracert.sh google.com
```

Output:
```
==========================================================
			NTraceroute
		     Where's my packet?
==========================================================
